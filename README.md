# MySQL-week-6
Final week of MySQL, team project 

Coding Steps:
This week you will be working together as a team to create a full CRUD application.
Your console CRUD application will need to use a database to store all the application data.
As a team, decide what you want your project to do. 
Get instructor approval early in the week before beginning development.
You need to have at least 3 entities.
Users should be able to interact via the console (i.e. Scanner(System.in)))
Everyone must individually submit their own assignment documents and the full code for the entire project. 
Inside the code, use comments to make it clear which code you specifically wrote. 
Although git provides collaboration functionality, you are not required to use it to 
collaborate back and forth with your teammates. You can use any method you decide on as a team.
